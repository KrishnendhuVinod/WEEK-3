Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science focused on creating computational systems capable of performing tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  AI applications range from commonplace tools like search engines and recommendation systems to more advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles and generative AI.  While many everyday applications utilize AI,  they are often not labeled as such once they become common.

AI research employs various techniques including search algorithms, logic, artificial neural networks, and statistical methods, drawing upon multiple disciplines like psychology and linguistics.  The field's long-term goal is artificial general intelligence (AGI)â€”AI capable of performing any human task at an equal or superior level.  AI's history has been marked by cycles of optimism and setbacks ("AI winters"), with recent years experiencing a resurgence of interest and funding driven by advances in deep learning and transformer architectures.  Ethical concerns surrounding AI, including bias, job displacement, and misuse, are also significant areas of ongoing discussion.
